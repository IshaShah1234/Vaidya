        <h1>Understanding the Symptoms of Malaria</h1><p>Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites that are transmitted to people through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. It is preventable and curable. Recognizing the symptoms of malaria early can be crucial for its effective treatment and prevention.</p><h2>Symptoms of Malaria</h2><p>The symptoms of malaria typically include high fever, headache, and chills. However, they can be mild and difficult to recognize as malaria. To complicate matters, the symptoms may not appear until several weeks after infection. In severe cases, malaria can cause severe anemia, seizures, mental confusion, kidney failure, coma, and death.</p><h3>Common Symptoms</h3><p>Common symptoms of malaria include fever, tiredness, vomiting, and headaches. In severe cases, it can cause yellow skin, seizures, coma, or death. Symptoms usually begin ten to fifteen days after being bitten by an infected mosquito. If not properly treated, people may have recurrences of the disease months later.</p><h3>Severe Malaria</h3><p>Severe malaria is usually caused by Plasmodium falciparum (often in Africa) and less often by Plasmodium vivax or Plasmodium knowlesi. Non-falciparum malaria is generally less severe, but worldwide it is actually more common.</p><h2>FAQs</h2><h3>What are the early signs of malaria?</h3><p>The early signs of malaria usually include fever, headache, chills, and vomiting. Symptoms may appear 10-15 days after the infective mosquito bite.</p><h3>Can malaria symptoms appear years after infection?</h3><p>Yes, some types of malaria parasites can lie dormant in the body for up to a year. Hence, it's possible for symptoms to appear years after infection.</p><h3>What should I do if I suspect I have malaria?</h3><p>If you suspect you have malaria, especially if you have recently travelled to a region where malaria is prevalent, you should seek medical help immediately. Early detection and treatment reduce the disease's severity and prevent deaths.</p>
